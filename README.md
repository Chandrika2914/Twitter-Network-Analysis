# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project explores how people express opinions on Twitter using Python and NLP techniques.  
I worked on this during my college course to analyze tweets, clean the data, and visualize overall sentiment trends.  
The goal was to understand public reactions and emotions around specific topics using real-time tweets.

## Objective
To analyze tweets and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and visualize the patterns through graphs and word clouds.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Tweepy (for fetching tweets)  
- TextBlob / NLTK (for sentiment analysis)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- WordCloud

## Project Workflow
**1. Data Collection** – Used Tweepy to fetch tweets related to a particular topic or hashtag.  
**2. Data Cleaning** – Removed URLs, mentions, emojis, punctuations, and stopwords.  
**3. Sentiment Analysis** – Classified tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using TextBlob polarity scores.  
**4. Visualization** – Created bar graphs, pie charts, and word clouds to represent sentiment distribution and top-used words.  
**5. Insights** – Observed public opinions, trending hashtags, and emotional tone of discussions.
